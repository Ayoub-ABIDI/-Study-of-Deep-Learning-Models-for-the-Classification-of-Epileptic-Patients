## Overview

This project presents a comparative study of deep learning architectures for classifying **epileptic patients** based on **EEG data**.
The goal is to explore and evaluate different preprocessing and modeling strategies to enhance the accuracy and clinical relevance of EEG-based epilepsy detection.
A simple **Streamlit interface** is provided to classify EEG data in real time, making the system suitable for practical use in clinical decision support.
